# IMDb Movie Analysis

This project demonstrates a simple data engineering task that reads data from a CSV file, filters movies based on their rating, and visualizes the number of movies in each genre using a bar chart. The dataset used is the "IMDb movie dataset" from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data).

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data) and place the `IMDB-Movie-Data.csv` file in the project folder.
3. Install the required libraries using `pip install pandas matplotlib`.
4. Run the script with `python imdb_movie_analysis.py`.
5. Check the generated bar chart `top_genres.png` in the project folder, showing the number of movies in each genre with a rating of 8.0 or higher.
